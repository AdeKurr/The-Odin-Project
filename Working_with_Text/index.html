         <h1>My Thought Process</h1>
         <p>People always have something in their mind. Unless they have something to focus on,
            their mind would go on random thought process which sometimes useful but sometimes bad.
            However, there are reason why they should have more time to let their brain to wander 
            off.

         <h2>The Brain's Two Modes</h2>
         <p>Imagine you were reading a book. You were rushing through the text lines and never seemed to stop.
            Then suddenly your book popped out of the existence and you were left with nothing. 
            Suddenly you were asked, "What were you reading?". Can you remember anything? Unless you stopped reading 
            to understand the text when you were reading, you would not understand or at least remember what's the text is 
            all about. It is because the brain has 2 modes, <strong>focus</strong> and <strong>diffuse</strong> mode.
         </p>
         <h3>Focus Mode</h3>
         <p>The brain's focus mode is when you are reading a line of text, looking at something, learning, etc.
            This mode is when the brain absorbs information from your senses. However, it does not mean that your 
            brain suddenly undestand think. Your brain needs an idle time to process everything that has been absorbed
            and place them all in the correct <em>storage</em>. This idle time is called the <strong>diffuse</strong> mode.
         </p>
         <h3>Diffuse Mode</h3>
         <p>Diffuse mode is the mode where your brain stops absorbing information from your senses and wanders around the things
            you've learned. This is the time where it sorts and places the abundand of information you've absorbed and place them all
            in order. This cause the brain to connect things and thus having new ideas in mind. This is an important process of the brain.
